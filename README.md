LISTEN TO THIS STORY: 

Mrs. Blessing works in a bank as a teller and below is her daily schedule.


She resumes in the morning, heads to the fault to take cash which she uses to open her account as a front desk teller.

There is a ledger account called vault on the system that holds the record of the exact value of funds kept in the banks vault the previous day while blessing has an operational account called till account via which she transacts on a daily basis. (money kept by a bank on its premises to meet day-to-day cash requirements)

To commence her day, blessing would have to request cash from the Vault which requires approval from the head of operations called Olumide and upon this approval, a maximum of N1,000,000 is moved in cash from vault account to blessing which should reflect on her till account.

Immediately this transaction is completed, the balance of funds (if any) in the fault account should be immediately moved to stanbic bank which is represented on the system as a ledger account called stanbic. The movement of the cash as deposit to stanbic requires the approval of the head of accounts called Philip.
